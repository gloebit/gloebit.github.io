      An application uses this endpoint to increase the quantity of a product in the inventory of the user account associated with the access token.  The endpoint checks that the product is enabled, can be granted, and, if it has a per-user limit, that the resulting quantity is at most the limit.  Product settings are available on the application's <a href="/app-config/">Gloebit Application Configuration</a> page.
