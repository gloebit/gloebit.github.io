id: authorize
name: Authorize
service: Authorization
desc:
  - p: >
      An application uses this endpoint to initiate the user authorization process.  The endpoint will acquire and return either an authorization code (for an <a href="!REFERENCE_URL!#auth-code">Authorization Code Grant</a> request) or access token (for an <a href="!REFERENCE_URL!#implicit">Implicit Grant</a> request).  It is returned via an HTTP 302 (redirect) response to a "redirect URI" provided by the application.
  - p: >
      The endpoint first verifies the provided redirect URI against the application's redirect prefixes (from the <a href="/app-config/">Gloebit Application Configuration</a> page).  Second, it prompts the user to log into Gloebit if not already logged on.  Third, it presents the user with an authorization page for the application and requested scope, and asks the user to confirm the request.  Fourth and last, it generates the requested grant and generates the redirect response.

      Upon success, the authorize endpoint sends a 302 (redirect) response for the redirect URI and appends the results to the URI (either as query arguments for the "code" response type or in the fragment for "token" response type.)
  - p: >
      If your authorize request used the "code" response type, the query arguments will containing the following:
    return:
      - name: code
        desc: Authorization code to exchange for an access token.
      - name: state
        desc: &STATE_DESC If your authorize request included a "state" argument, the same value will be returned here.  If your request did not include a "state" argument, there will not be a "state" argument in the redirect response.
  - p: >
      If your authorize request used the "token" response type, the fragment portion of the URI will contain the following:
    return:
      - name: token
        desc: Access token for requested user and scope.
      - name: token_type

      Authorization failures can result in two different outcomes.  The outcome is determined by the type of failure.
  - p: >
      If the user rejects authorization or Gloebit detects an invalid redirect URI in the request, the authorize endpoint will take the user to a Gloebit page with information about the request failure.  This page includes a trackback link to the requesting application.
  - p: >
      In all other cases, the authorize endpoint sends a 302 (redirect) response for the redirect URI and appends query arguments containing error information for your application:
    return:
      - name: error
        desc: Error code string (defined in <a href="http://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc6749#section-4.1.2.1">OAuth 2.0 specification</a>).

        desc: A more detailed explanation of the failure reason.  May not always be included.
      - name: state

notes:

    Preferred HTTP method is to redirect the user's browser to the authorize URI.
