      The endpoint always returns an HTTP 200 code along with a JSON object:
    return:
      - name: success
        desc: |
          Possible values: "true", "false".<br>
          "true" - Character creation succeeded.<br>
          "false" - Request failed.

        desc: |
          Dictionary of new character information (if request succeeded):<br>
          &nbsp;&nbsp;id: Gloebit UUID for new character.
          &nbsp;&nbsp;name: Name of new character.
          &nbsp;&nbsp;&lt;...&gt;: Additional parameters, if any.
      - name: reason
        desc: Short description of why request failed.
notes:
  - >
    If character name is not unique among character names created for the application, the request will fail with success "false" and a reason indicating the non-uniqueness.  Eventually, we would like to return a list of alternative name suggestions in this case.
  - >
    This endpoint requires that the application get the character name.  We welcome suggestions for the look-and-feel of an endpoint flow that would involve Gloebit handling character name entry for your application.
