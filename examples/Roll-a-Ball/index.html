  <article>
    <p>
      Roll the ball around the arena with the arrow keys (or ASDW keys).  Pick up the 12 objects as fast as you can.  The first roll is free.  Subsequent rolls cost 1 gloebit.
    </p>
    <p>
      After clicking on the button to play again, the game will bring up Gloebit in your browser so you can log in and authorize the game's access to your account.  After authorizing in your browser, make sure you give the game focus again (by clicking on it) so the Unity player will continue working and finish the transaction.
