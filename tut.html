          The Gloebit Sandbox
        </h3>

        <p>Gloebit provides a sandbox server that helps you start integrating Gloebit services quickly.  It also provides all Gloebit functionality so you can fully test your design before switching over to the production Gloebit server.</p>

        <p>This sandbox walk-through and guide takes you through the steps to get your design up and and going in the Gloebit sandbox.  So, let's get started.</p>

        <h3>
          <a name="prereqs" class="anchor" href="#prereqs">
            <span class="octicon octicon-link"></span>
          </a>
          Gloebit Merchant Prequisites
        </h3>

        <p>Whether on the production or the sandbox server, a Gloebit merchant needs the following to use Gloebits:</p>

        <ol>
          <li>A merchant Gloebit account (on the server)</li>
          <li>An integrated Gloebit API</li>
        </ol>

        <h3>
          <a name="account" class="anchor" href="#account">
            <span class="octicon octicon-link"></span>
          </a>
          Creating Your Merchant Account
        </h3>

        <p>This guides starts by having you set up your sandbox merchant account.  If you would rather immediately start integrating an API, you can skip this step and instead <a href="#test-merchant">use the test merchant account</a> for now.  When ready to use your own account, you can come back to this step.</p>

        <h4>Signup for a Gloebit Sandbox Account</h4>

        <ol>
          <li>Visit the <a href="https://sandbox.gloebit.com/signup/">Gloebit sandbox signup page</a>.
            <p>You can either create your account using an email and password you provide specifically for the Gloebit sandbox or you can authenticate via one of our third-party ID providers (Google+, LinkedIn, Twitter, Facebook) to create your sandbox account.</p>
            <p>The account you create here allows you to buy and spend Gloebits.  The next steps upgrade your account to use the Gloebit merchant services.</p>
            <p>After creating your account or authenticating via a third party, Gloebit will present its user terms of service.  You will see this only when creating your sandbox account or when you log into the sandbox after we have updated the user terms of service.</p>
          </li>
          <li>Read through the user terms of service and click on "Agree".
            <p>After clicking, you will see the Account Settings page for your sandbox account.  Now let's turn it into a sandbox merchant account.</p>
          </li>
          <li>Visit the <a href="https://sandbox.gloebit.com/merchant-signup/">Gloebit sandbox merchant signup page</a>.
            <p>You will see a form here asking for a variety of information for your merchant account.  On the sandbox server, none of it is required.  Go ahead and scroll down to the bottom of the form and click on the "Save" button.</p>
            <p>After clicking on "Save" to submit your merchant request, you will return to your Account Settings page.  Notice that the alert icon (bell, top-right of page) has a red 1, indicating a new message.</p>
          </li>
          <li>Click on the alert icon to see the message.
            <p>The new message should be an approval for your merchant signup request.  Merchant approval is automatic on the sandbox server and gives you full access to all merchant features.  (The production server's merchant signup occurs in stages for the various features.)</p>
            <p>If you click on the message, the check mark icon will change to an X, meaning the alert will be deleted.  If you click on the message again, the X will change back to a check mark and the alert will not be deleted.  And if you click again... it's a toggle.</p>
            <p>The red number on the alert icon indicates how many alert messages you have queued up.  The number changes only when you visit another page or reload the current page.  It decreases only if you click on messages to have them deleted.</p>
          </li>
          <li>Click the left side of the header bar (on your account name/email, on the head icon to its left, or on the blue sliver at the left end of the header.)
            <p>Now that you have a merchant account, there are two new items in the menu:</p>
            <ul>
              <li>Merchant Tools</li>
              <li>Merchant Products</li>
            </ul>
            <p>The Merchant Tools page is important in general.  For this walk-through specifically, it has your OAuth key and secret.</p>
          </li>
          <li>Click on Merchant Tools.
            <p>Because this is the first time you are accessing a merchant page, Gloebit will present its merchant terms of service.  You will see this only when first accessing one of the merchant pages or when you first access one after we have updated the merchant terms of service.</p>
          </li>
          <li>Read through the merchant terms of service and click on "Agree".
            <p>After clicking, you will see your Merchant Tools page.</p>
          </li>
          <li>Scroll down the Merchant Tools page and find the OAuth section.
            <p>Gloebit uses OAuth for authenticating you and your users.  Your application will need the Key and Secret from this page when you send your users to Gloebit to grant access to your application.  Remember where these fields are (or save them somewhere).</p>
          </li>
        </ol>

        <p>And with that, you are ready to <a href="#api">integrate a Gloebit API</a>.

        <h3>
          <a name="test-merchant" class="anchor" href="#test-merchant">
            <span class="octicon octicon-link"></span>
          </a>
          Using the Test Merchant Account
        </h3>

        <p>Skip this section and go to <a href="#api">Connecting a Gloebit API</a> if you followed the steps above for creating your merchant account.
        <h3>
          <a name="api" class="anchor" href="#api">
            <span class="octicon octicon-link"></span>
          </a>
          Connecting a Gloebit API
        </h3>

        <p>Users and merchants create accounts on Gloebit's website.  An
        application associated with a merchant account uses OAuth2 to get a
        user's permission to interacts with their account.</p>

        <p>Users purchase gloebits on Gloebit's website -- Gloebit
        takes care of interfacing with various payment providers.  Once a user
        has a balance of gloebits, an application can exchange entitlements or
        digital inventory for the user's gloebits.</p>
