      <h1>Change Log</h1>
      <p>Updates to GMM since open beta launch in January 2017</p>

      <h2>Build 75 on 2018-09-11</h2>
      <ul>
        <li>Fixed a messaging bug</li>
        <li>Updated standard for economymodule setting to be in [Economy] section rather than [Startup] section of configs.  GMM now looks in both locations and disables if another module is specified unless the GMM is enabled for specific regions in the Gloebit.ini file.</li>
        <li>Updated [Economy]SellEnabled to default to true as the configs state it does.  Previously we defaulted to false.</li>
        <li>Changed many info level log messages to debug level.</li>
        <li>Rearchitected GMM and added documentation in preparation for open sourcing repository under the LGPLv3 license.</li>
      </ul>
      <br />
      <h2>Build 73 on 2017-08-18</h2>
      <ul>
        <li>Implemented new MoneyModule interface function added to the OpenSim Core.  The addition of this interface was causing crashes on 0.9.1-dev as of late July and on 0.9.0-release as the 0.9.1 dev changes were pulled into the 0.9.0-release.  These should all work now.</li>
        <li>Implemented LandPass sales for all versions of OpenSim (including 0.8.x).</li>
        <li>Implemented new LandPass sales flow added by OpenSim core and in place in 0.9.1-dev and 0.9.0 release</li>
      </ul>
      <br />
      <h2>Build 69 on 2017-06-02</h2>
      <ul>
        <li>Fixed multithreading issue which occassionally caused land purchases to fail on some grids</li>
        <li>Removed the IM with the gloebit purchase link which previously was sent on every new session</li>
      </ul>
      <br />
      <h2>Build 68 on 2017-03-15</h2
      <ul>
        <li>Fixed bug causing crashes on a couple grids where we were dereferencing a client which was somehow unexpectedly null.  Now check for null and return and log an the error.</li>
      </ul>
