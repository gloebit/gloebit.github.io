We've been working with digital currencies for years, since well before the entrance of [Bitcoin](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bitcoin), and we have many opinions we've locked away for too long.  We hope you'll find our posts worthwhile, and when you have questions or expertise on a subject, will contribute to the dialog via the comments section.  Also, please consider following our authors, and following Gloebit to support us and to receive alerts when we've posted new content.
