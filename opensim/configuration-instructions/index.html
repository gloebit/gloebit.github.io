      <p>Enabling Gloebit on your OpenSim grid is quick and simple.  There are 3 easy steps.</p>
      <aside>If you use a hosting provider, they should be able to handle step 3 for you.</aside>
      <ol>
        <li>Request account permission to create apps</li>
        <li>Create a Gloebit app</li>
        <li>Install and configure the Gloebit Money Module</li>
      </ol>
      <p>The details for each of these is below.  Just follow the step by step instructions.</p>
      <p>We have two environments, a Sandbox testing environment and Production.  All of the instructions below are for our Production environment, but if you want to test with fake payments and gloebits, you can replace <i>www</i> with <i>sandbox</i> in all the links below.</p>
    </section>

    <section class="wrapper anchor" id="app-permission">
      <h2>Request account permission to create apps</h2>
      <p>If you haven't already, <a href="https://www.gloebit.com/signup/">create a Gloebit account</a>.  Remember that our Sanbox and Production environments use completely separate accounts, so if you've been testing on Sandbox, you'll still need to create a Production account and go through all the steps below from that account to create a Production app.</p>
      <p>From your Gloebit account, fill in and submit our <a href="https://www.gloebit.com/merchant-signup/">form for requesting app creation permission</a>.  We just need some basic contact info.</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Company name and address are optional.  If your grid or space is owned by a company, you should enter the company information.</li>
        <li>Product name should probably be the grid name for a private grid, or what you call your space on the grid if you are on a public grid.</li>
        <li>Product url should be the url of the website for your grid or space if you have one.</li>
        <li>The Contact name, email and phone number should be the real life info of someone in charge of this grid or space (probably you who is signing up).</li>
        <li>Click submit once you have entered your information</li>
      </ul>
      <p>You'll need to wait for us to review your request before you can move to creating your app.  We'll email you once we have.</p>
    </section>

    <section class="wrapper anchor" id="app-creation">
      <h2>Create a Gloebit app</h2>
      <p>Once your account has been granted permission to create apps, you'll gain access to your <a href="https://www.gloebit.com/merchant-tools/">merchant tools page</a> where you can create and edit your apps.  Go there and either click <i>Configure</i> next to an existing app (we may have created one for you labeled "Unknown") or the <i>Add an Application</i> button, which will take you to an app settings page.  Follow the instructions below to set up your app.</p>
      <ul>
        <aside>You can learn about all of the app settings <a href="/app-config/">here</a> if you are curious.</aside>
        <li>Enter a <b>Name</b> (probably the grid name or name of the space on which Gloebit will be enabled) and <b>Short Description</b> for your app.  These are what users will see when they are asked to authorize your app to access their Gleobit account (as well as the logo below).</li>
        <li><b>Publisher</b> can be left blank.  It is displayed on our <a href="https://www.gloebit.com/apps/">app discovery page</a> and is a way that a company with many apps could show they are all owned by the same company.  You can put your grid/company name here.  You could also put the name of your hosting provider here if you like.</li>
        <li>Upload a <b>Logo</b>. This is important because users see it when authorizing.  We recommend rough dimensions of 169px wide x 108px high.  We will shrink the image down to fit inside those dimensions.</li>
        <li><b>Return-to Text</b> can be left blank.</li>
        <li><b>Default Return-To URI</b> should be set to the web page for your grid or space or some url which explains what their space is or how to connect.  It can be left blank if you don't have a website.  This url will be provided alongside your app on certain sections of our site.</li>
        <li>If you check the <b>Make application findable</b> box, once we review it, your app will show up on our <a href="https://www.gloebit.com/apps/">app discovery page</a>.</li>
        <li>In the Gloebit Authorization section below, copy the <b>OAuth Key</b> and <b>OAuth Secret</b>.  You'll need these (or will need to provide them to your hosting provider) to configure the Gloebit Money Module to connect to this app.  You can also retrieve these later by clicking on <i>Configure</i> next to this app on your merchant tools page.</li>
        <li>Scroll to the bottom of the page and click the <i>Save</i> button.  You can ignore the other settings on this page, as well as the warning at the top about callback prefixes as they are not designed for the OpenSim GMM.</li>
      </ul>
      <p>Now you have an app and you're ready to install and configure the GMM.</p>
    </section>
    
    <section class="wrapper anchor" id="gmm-configuration">
      <h2>Configuration</h2>
      <ol>
        <li><b>Install:</b> We will provide you with Gloebit.dll and Gloebit.ini.
          <ul>
            <li>Place <i>Gloebit.dll</i> in your opensim/bin/ directory.</li>
            <li>Place <i>Gloebit.ini</i> in your ConfigDirectory.  By default, this is also opensim/bin/.  If you are unsure, you can locate the ConfigDirectory value in the [Startup] section of opensim.ini.</li>
          </ul>
        </li>
        <li><b>Enable:</b> Make required edits to Gloebit.ini and opensim.ini.
          <ul>
            <li>In Gloebit.ini, set <i>GLBEnvironment = production</i> (or set it to <i>sandbox</i> for a testing app created in our sandbox environment).
            <li>In Gleobit.ini, set <i>GLBKey</i> and <i>GLBSecret</i> to the "OAuth Key" and "OAuth Secret" from the application you created above.</li>
            <li>To enable Gloebit across the entire process (for all regions running under this single OpenSim process):</li>
            <ul>
              <li>In Gloebit.ini, set <i>Enabled = true</i></li>
              <li>In opensim.ini, set <i>economymodule = Gloebit</i> (you may need to add this line to the end of your [Startup] section.</li>
            </ul>
            <li>To enable Gloebit only for specific regions running under this single OpenSim process:</li>
            <ul>
              <li>In Gloebit.ini, set <i>Enabled = false</i></li>
              <li>In Gloebit.ini, set <i>GLBEnabledOnlyInRegion</i> to a whitespace separated list of the region UUIDs for which you would like the GMM enabled.</li>
            </ul>
          </ul>
        </li>
        <li><b>Improved Robust Experience:</b> Configure all sims to use the same database
          <ul>
            <li>If you are running multiple sim processes/servers with the GMM enabled, then we recommend you create a single Gloebit database on a server which all sim processes can access, such as on your robust server.  If each sim has it's own database, then your users will have to authorize Gloebit from each sim rather than once and will receive session messaging upon entering each sim rather than once per session.</li>
            <li>Use <i>GLBSpecificConnectionString</i> and <i>GLBSpecificStorageProvider</i> to define a different database for the Gloebit Tables.  If not set, the GMM will use the default ConnectionString set by the DatabaseService section of your configuration.</li>
            <li>You may need to configure your database to allow connections from remote servers and your firewall to allow connections on port 3306 for your sim servers.  You can find <a href="https://easyengine.io/tutorials/mysql/remote-access/">instructions</a> for this online, but this is advanced, so you should not attempt this unless you know how to secure your firewall.</li>
          </ul>
        </li>
        <li><b>Optional Gloebit Configuration Options:</b> Make additional edits to Gloebit.ini for improved, user-friendly behavior (None of these are required).
          <ul>
            <li>If you entered an "OAuth Key Alias" for your application, you can set <i>GLBKeyAlias</i> to this value.</li>
            <li>Set <i>GLBOwnerName</i> and <i>GLBOwnerEmail</i> to the name and contact details of a manager of this OpenSim process.  These are displayed with certain error messages if there is a configuration issue and user is asked to report this problem to this manager.</li>
            <li>Use <i>GLBSpecificConnectionString</i> and <i>GLBSpecificStorageProvider</i> to define a different database for the Gloebit Tables.  If not set, the GMM will use the default ConnectionString set by the DatabaseService section of your configuration.</li>
          </ul>
        </li>
        <li><b>Optional OpenSim Configuration Options:</b>
          <ul>
            <li>Set the currency symbol to <b>G$</b>
              <ul>
                <li>Be aware that this is a grid wide setting, so you may not want to do this if other currency systems are on use in your grid.</li>
                <li>Set <i>Currency = "G$"</i> in the [LoginService] section of StandaloneCommon.ini, Robust.ini, or Robust.HG.ini.</li>
              </ul>
            </li>
            <li>Make land sales work
              <ul>
                <li>For standalone grids, Gloebit can handle this direclty from our module if the economy helper-uri is configured.  See "Configure the economy helper-uri" below.</li>
                <li>For robust grids, a script is required on the robust server and the economy helper-uri must also be configured.
                  <ul>
                    <li>see "Configure the economy helper-uri" below for how to configure this uri.</li>
                    <li>Your robust server needs a landtool.php script to handle pre-flight checks from the viewer before it will deliver the land purchase event to our module.  We recommend this <a href="https://github.com/justincc/opensimulator-helper">repository from justincc</a> for both the landtool.php script and instructions on how to install it.</li>
                  </ul>
                </li>
              </ul>
            </li>
            <li>Make the "Buy Currency" button work
              <ul>
                <li>If configured, on clicking "Buy Currency", or upon attempting to purchase an object with insufficient funds, this will present an unauthorized user with an authorization message, and will present an authorized user with a cost estimate, and upon clicking purchase, a message with a link to purchase gloebits.  We can not yet sell gloebits direclty from the viewer.</li>
                <li>For standalone grids, Gloebit can handle this directly from our module if the economy helper-uri is configured.  See "Configure the economy helper-uri" below.</li>
                <li>For robust grids, a currency.php script is required in addition to properly configuring the economy helper-uri.  We have not yet found a drop-in currency.php file, nor have we had a chance to write one.  If someone can provide this resource, please let us know.</li>
              </ul>
            </li>
            <li>Configure the economy helper-uri
              <ul>
                <li>This is required for land sales and for the Buy Currency button to work.  See the above sections for additonal details on how to make these function.</li>
                <li>When changing the economy helper-uri, testing can be challenging. I have discovered the following with Firestorm.  If the grid I am testing is the one currently selected to log into, then it will not refresh the economy helper-uri, so I first need to select a different grid from the main screen.  Then, I need to open preferences->advanced, select my grid, click refresh, and then click apply.  Then I can set the grid to log into back to the my grid, log in, and test it.</li>
                <li>The economy setting is in the [GridInfoService] secion of your StandaloneCommon.ini, Robust.ini or Robust.HG.ini depending upon your OpenSim configuration.</li>
                <li>For standalone grids, this must be configured to point at a region with Gloebit enabled, effectively <i>http://&lt;IP or Domain of Grid&gt;:&lt;Port of Region with Gloebit enabled&gt;</i>.
                  <ul>
                    <li>You can find the port for each region in your Regions.ini file.  Your first region is usually on port 9000 by default</li>
                    <li>If your [CONST] section is configured in OpenSim.ini, then you can simply uncomment this to <i>economy = ${Const|BaseURL}:9000/</i> and update the port if  necessary.  Otherwise, you can hard code this like <i>economy = https://www.mygrid.com:9000/</i>.</li>
                  </ul>
                </li>
                <li>For robust grids, this must be configured to point at the folder where you have placed landtool.php and if you have it, currency.php.
                  <ul>
                    <li>This folder and these scripts must be accessible to anyone who has logged into your grid</li>
                    <li>If your [CONST] section is configured in OpenSim.ini, then you can simply uncomment this to <i>economy = ${Const|BaseURL}/economy</i> and replace "economy" with the path to this folder.  Otherwise, you can hard code this like <i>economy = https://www.mygrid.com/economy</i>.</li>
                  </ul>
                </li>
              </ul>
            </li>
          </ul> 
        </li>
