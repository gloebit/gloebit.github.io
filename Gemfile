# You might need to comment out the following four lines to start
# a local jekyll server (for debug before deploymnet).  There is
# some bug in jekyll or listener or something that could cause the
# "bundle exec jekyll serve" to silently exit shortly after starting.
#
# Once you have the server running, it will tell you to put these
# lines in your Gemfile.  Uncomment them and save once you see that.
# Do this right away lest the server will poll every minute or so
# and rebuild continually.
