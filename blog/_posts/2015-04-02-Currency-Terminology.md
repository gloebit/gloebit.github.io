**"Virtual currency, digital currency, Crypto-currency, Bitcoin... these are all the same thing, right?"**

This question has arisen in some form in almost every interview, advising session, talk, or just plain conversation in which I've partaken regarding [Gloebit](https://www.gloebit.com/) and the field of [FinTech](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Financial_technology) (financial technology).  My answer has always been **"No!"**, but industry consensus has been lacking on some specifics of the terminology.  My goal here is to educate where consensus exists and promote some concepts toward consensus.

## First, a little history from my perspective: ##

### At Second Life, we called it virtual currency. ###

From 2007 through 2011, I had the pleasure of working on Linden Lab's Second Life virtual world and at some point, I became the defacto federal reserve chair, running the economy and maintaining the money supply much like the Fed of the USA.  The product may have been virtual, but the economy was very real.  At over *$500 million* in user-to-user transactions per year, it sat around 185th in the [list of countries by GDP](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_countries_by_GDP_%28nominal%29#Lists), in the company of some small island nations.  Many residents (what we called the Second Life users) earned a full-time living off of the product in Linden Dollars, the virtual currency of the platform, which could be "cashed out", or exchanged into USD.  Still, we called it a _virtual_ currency because it was playfully used only in our world, because it only existed in this digital space of bits, and because we wanted to differentiate it from the currencies of the countries around the world.

### At Gloebit, we built a digital currency. ###

In 2012, when I founded Gloebit, I made a very concious decision to replace the word _virtual_ with the word _digital_.  To many, these meant the same thing, but I wanted to differentiate gloebits from linden dollars.  I was making a long-term branding play.  Gloebits are not just for games, for some playful space.  They would be a payment method, a mechanism for commerce in many spaces.  The whole concept of Gloebit is a single digital currency which spans many products and platforms, not just usable in a single virtual world or game.  I wanted to retain the concept that this was not printed, had all the benefits and cost savings of existing only in the digital ether, but I wanted to put a stake in the ground about the breadth of its intended usage.  Gloebits were not a walled garden for use in my products; they were an open service for use by all companies and products.

### "Digital currency, you mean that Bitcoin thing, right?" ###

In 2013, Bitcoin took the world, or at least the media, by storm.  It captured enough attention that it entered the general lexicon, but not enough attention for the average person or the media to seem to learn what it actually was or how it worked.  It was often referred by all of the terms virtual, digital and crypto, and occassionally, everything else was referred to as a type of Bitcoin the same way that [tissues](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Facial_tissue) might wrongly be referred to as a type of [Kleenex](https://www.kleenex.com/).

Two years later, things haven't changed much.  It actually takes me _longer_ to explain what my product is due to the general awareness of Bitcoin and the lack of general clarity in terminology.  Last week, I found myself correcting a reference to Bitcoin as a virtual currency in a draft of a _payments white paper_ for the [Application Developers Alliance](http://www.appdevelopersalliance.org/).  I decided it was time to have a broader impact.

## Let's create some consensus: ##

### Virtual Currency ###

A [virtual currency](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Virtual_currency) is for use in a single product or on a single platform.  It is managed and controlled by the same company who produces that product or platform.   Almost everyone has used one of these whether they know it or not.  Have you ever purchased some sort of coin or gem in a an app and then spent those gems to purchase something in the app such as extra lives, a character, a hat or new features?  Guess What?  Those gems were a virtual currency.  A notable platform example is [Amazon Coins](http://www.amazon.com/gp/feature.html?docId=1001166401).  There are many popular games with currencies, one of which is [HearthStone Gold](http://hearthstone.gamepedia.com/Gold).

Some would restrict the term virtual currency strictly to digital tokens which a user can purchase and/or sell for a government currency such as USD, focusing on the tie in to traditional payment methods.  I am much more liberal with the term, and use it for any platform specific medium of exchange, even those earned within the platform.  In my view, any reward system where you earn points instead of a dollar value, such as airline frequent flyer miles, is also a type of virtual currency.  Additionally, any in-game resource such as minerals, lumber or energy which is earned or mined and spent on in-game production is also a very simple virtual currency.

### Digital Currency ###

Whether or not the term [digital currency](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Digital_currency) describes a superset including virtual currency as a subset, or is a complementary set distinct from virtual currency is up for debate.  Even the single Wikipedia page on the subject has both a section which [supports](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Digital_currency#Definition) and one which [disputes](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Digital_currency#Digital_versus_virtual_currency) overlap of the two.  

I am of the school of thought which treats digital currency as a distinct set, separated from virtual currency by the breadth of intended use.  Whereas a virtual currency is restricted to use on a single platform, and tightly controlled by that platform, a digital currency is open for use by any platform, and control is outside the scope of a single platform.  A digital currency, by this definition, must supply a service, protocol, or interface for platforms to tie into.

###Centralization###

The digital currency space is bifurcated into centralized and decentralized digital currency.  As opposed to the terms digital and virtual which refer to the breadth of availabiity of the currency, centralization refers to how the currency is managed.  

In a centralized system, there is a single authority who at a minimum controls the money supply (amount of the currency in circulation), and generally also controls transaction processing and records, and User account creation, balances, and access.  All government fiat currencies are centralized.  The federal reserve bank is the central authority controlling the supply of US$.  By their nature, all virtual currencies are also centralized.

In a decentralized system, there is no single authority with control over the system.  No entity has the power to create currency to grow the money supply.  Generally, some public process manages account creation and access and transaction processing and records, enabling peer-to-peer transactions.  Crypto-currencies are decentralized.  Precious metals may be considered a form of decentralized currency in the physical world. 

### Centralized Digital Currency ###

A centralized digital currency is for use across many platforms, but with a single central authority who oversees the access to and controls the currency.  This authority is responsible for granting platforms and consumers access to the currency, increasing or decreasing the amount of the currency in circulation, processing and recording transactions, and maintaining user account information.

[Gloebits](http://dev.gloebit.com/monetize/#gloebits) are a centralized digital currency.  [Gloebit](https://www.gloebit.com) is the central authority which manages access to [gloebits](http://dev.gloebit.com/#monetizing) via a set of [web services](http://dev.gloebit.com).

### Decentralized Digital Currency ###

A decentralized digital currency is for use across many platforms, and has no single central authority who oversees the access to and controls the currency.  Some process must be defined and agreed upon across the community of users of such a currency for how the money supply will be adjusted, transactions will be processed, and accounts will be maintained.

### Crypto-currency ###

A [crypto-currency](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cryptocurrency) is a specific flavor of a decentralized digital currency.  Complex cryptography, along with a public record of all previous transactions, or [block-chain](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bitcoin#Block_chain), is used to verify a transaction between users rather than a central authority.  Production of new currency is predefined via an algorithm and is awarded to users (owners of computer nodes) who solve the cryptographic equations required to process the transacitons.

Because growth of a standard crypto-currency money supply is finite and many users are doing work to try to attain the next "nugget" of currency produced, production of currency has been likened to the mining of precious metals and these users are often referred to as miners.  Since the amount of money supply in circulation is handled in this predefined fashion, rather than adjusted by a central authority according to demand, the value of a unit of a crypto-curreny can be quite volatile, leading to speculation in the market.  The behavior of crypto-currencies and the activity that behavior enables is much more akin to the commodity market than the currency market, and so, I prefer to refer to them as _crypto-commodities_.  

### Bitcoin and altcoins ###

[Bitcoin](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bitcoin) is specific instance of crypto-currency and was the first to reach subtantial usage.  Since the creation of Bitcoin, many alternative crypto-currencies have popped up, bringing rise to the term "altcoin" which refers to any crypto-currency other than Bitcoin.

## Cementing the Foundation ##

The organizatin above is meant to provide a foundation, not a final structure.  The area of alternative currencies is complex and evolving daily.  I've attempted to include enough detail and depth that an average interested person can gain some understanding and use clear, accurate terminology.  There will always be exceptions and products which don't fit neatly within the simple boxes I've outlined.  For instance, government fiat currencies like the US Dollar have a centrally managed money supply, but decentralized transaction processing where one person can pay another in cash directly.  Alternatively, credit cards fit much more neatly into the centralized bucket.  Ideally, this post will serve as the reasonably simple base, from which deeper dives into the minutia will start.
